It uses 'gum' to create interactive menus. Here’s how it works:

- Use the ARROW KEYS (↑/↓) to navigate.
- Use the SPACEBAR to select/unselect an option (look for the [x]).
- Press ENTER to confirm your choices.

The script will pause at each step requiring your input. Please stay tuned to make your selections as needed.
